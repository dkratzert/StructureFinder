Explanation and Advice for the Reported ALERTS
===============================================================================
 
===============================================================================
ALERT_250 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
===============================================================================
 
 An average value of the U(i,j) tensor of the asymmetric unit of a residue
 is calculated. An ALERT is generated when the corresponding U3/U1 ratio
 deviates significantly from 1.0. Large values of this ratio should be taken
 as an indication of possible systematic errors in the data or errors in
 the model. Visual inspection of an ORTEP plot will show that many
 displacement ellipsoids have their major axis pointing in the same direction.
 
===============================================================================
ALERT_302 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.
===============================================================================
 
 Atom sites that are not fully occupied are counted. A large fraction of
 disordered atoms may be both a signal for serious structure analysis
 problems or less reliable/interesting results.
 
===============================================================================
ALERT_413 Type_2 Indicator that the Structure Model may be Wrong or Deficient.
===============================================================================
 
 Short intermolecular H..H contacts may indicate incorrectly determined
 structures (i.e. wrong symmetry, missed translation symmetry, wrong position
 with reference to the symmetry elements, hydrogen atoms on atoms where there
 should not be any  etc..). Short intermolecular contacts may be indicative
 for inconsistent symmetry data (e.g. coordinates for space-group P43 and
 symmetry specified as P41 or P21/n & P21/c confusions). Short contacts are
 defined using a van der Waals radius of 1.2 Angstrom. Short H .. H contact
 involving CH3 H-atoms are often hampered by the fact that they involve
 H atoms at not optimal calculated positions.
 
===============================================================================
ALERT_790 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.
===============================================================================
 
 Unless for a good reason, molecular species should be transformed
 (by symmetry and/or translation) so that their centres of gravity
 are close to or within the unitcell bounds. This is a strict rule for the
 main species. Deviations from this general rule are for smaller additional
 species when relevant for intermolecular interactions with the main species.
 
===============================================================================
ALERT_795 Type_4 Improvement, Methodology, Query or Suggestion.
===============================================================================
 
 Atoms in the CIF are not given in logical order (i.e. C1, C2 etc.)
 The recommended procedure is to sort the atom list in some logical
 order before the final refinement cycles.
 
===============================================================================
ALERT_860 Type_3 Indicator that the Structure Quality may be Low.
===============================================================================
 
 The use of restraints used in the refinement should be explained in
 the write-up of a structure analysis.
 
 Note: An exception are restraints for floating origins (e.g. in P21).
