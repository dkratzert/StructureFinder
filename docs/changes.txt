StructureFinder Changelog
-------------------------

* v85 Fixed potential crash with malformed .res files.
* v84 Fixed crash of update notification dialog at program startup.
* v83 Added plotting of table data.
* v82 Improved internal structure of the indexer. This made it slightly faster and better maintainable.
      Option to disable indexing from .zip etc. archives added. Doesn't crash with CIF files where the element name
      has a charge like O2- anymore. Added .7zip file support. Better support for unusual .res files.
* v81 Added possibility to activate more table columns with right-click menu on table header.
      Fixed CIF file names from archives in table. 
      Improved sorting of columns. Columns are now movable.  
* v80 A missing directory doesn't let the program crash anymore on file open actions. A double click or 
      right click can open the directory of the current structure (Only works on the same computer).
      Added a filter checkbox to hide files in archives.
* v79 Improved program executable which can now be pinned to the taskbar. Updated updater executable.
* v78 Improved threshold of volume prefilter to be suitable for inaccurate unit cells.
* v77 The distribution architecture of the application was changed so that
       virus scanners should detect StructureFinder as malicious software less often.
* v76 Hardened file indexer against damaged zip files.
* v75 Fixed merging of databases where a table, e.g. the authors table, is empty.
* v74 Several small improvements.
* v73 Minor bugs fixed. New pypi package added: [https://pypi.org/project/structurefinder](https://pypi.org/project/structurefinder)
* v72 Use _iucr_refine_instructions_details if _shelx_res_file is not found in CIF.
* v71 Fixed crash when appending a database while no database is opened. Show labels in structure view.
* v70 Small improvements.
* v69 Add merging of two databases.
* v68 New icons and small bugfix.
* v67 Gives the user the possibility to set the path of the CellCheckCSD executable itself.
* v66 Some small fixes. Improved determination of space group type of .res files.
      Fixed crash by malformed symm cards during indexing.
* v65 Improved determination of space group type and IT-Number from available information of 
      CIF and res files.
* v64 Adds new CIF parser. CIFs with data_global are now recognized and the values of 
      the first gobal as well as the first data block are used for indexing.
      Indexing should be slightly faster now and might recognize different CIFs sometimes. 
* v63 Added author search in text search fields where these CIF keys are taken into account:
      _audit_author_name, _audit_contact_author_name, _publ_contact_author_name,
      _publ_contact_author, _publ_author_name
      Fixes reset of state when nothing is found. Text search is much faster for large databases.
      Fixes display of disordered molecules.
      Fixes crash with malformed unit cell input.s
* v62 Adds modification time to text search results. Fixes reading of multi-CIFs.
      'Update Now' button works again. Adds start scripts for Linux and Windows.
* v61 Fixed unit cell search. It had a much too high threshold.
      Added background indexing without blocking GUI. Indexing can be aborted now.
      Other smaller improvements.
* v60 Massive speed improvement for loading large databases. Adds a 'Last Modified' 
      column to the results table. The table is sortable by clicking on the column header now.
      Replaced the molecule viewer with a lighter one which results in a smaller install package. 
      Removed APEX database support, because searching in APEX itself works now better than in 
      StructureFinder. Some smaller improvements.
* v59 Fixed crash when running offline.
* v58 Fix crash during CIF export. Added CIF export to web interface.
* v57 Added button to export the currently selected structure as CIF. This CIF is not the original CIF!
* v56 Minor corrections.
* v55 Display database file name below main table.
* v54 Small correction.
* v53 Fixed crash when database location changes.
* v52 Unit cell is visible again.
* v51 Fixed crash on CIF files with values like 1.234().
* v50 Fixed major bug that made advanced search useless.
* v49 Added possibility to search for CCDC numbers. Small other improvements.
* v48 Saves last dir to settings. Added append button to append new directories.
* v47 Fixed bug with non-centrosymmetric shelx files. More compatible win32 version.
* v46 Fixed bug in cif parser that prevented reading of atoms from files written by Crystals
* v45 Fixed installation problems on some systems.
* v44 Small improvements in the cif file parser.
* v43 Added search option for R1 in advanced search.
* v42 Fixed some more minor search bugs.
* v41 Fixed completely wrong result for "more results" option. Added distinction between unit cells
     from APEX and unit cells from files for optimal search thresholds. Made search behavior more intuitive.
* v40 Improved program startup.
* v39 Fixed bug that could stall the application while loading QWebEngineView.
* v38 _data name was shown incorrectly.
* v37 Fixed some minor search issues.

* v30 Added search in CellCeckCSD database. You need to install CellChekCSD in order to search CSD data.
* v29 Fixed missing shelxfile directory in 32bit installer.
* v28 Faster structure display. Some bugs fixed.
