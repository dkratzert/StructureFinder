Changelog
---------
* v63 Added author search in text search fields where these CIF keys are taken into account:
      _audit_author_name, _audit_contact_author_name, _publ_contact_author_name,
      _publ_contact_author, _publ_author_name
      Fixes reset of state when nothing is found. Text search is much faster for large databases.
      Fixes display of disordered molecules.
* v62 Adds modification time to text search results. Fixes reading of multi-CIFs.
      'Update Now' button works again. Adds start scripts for Linux and Windows.
* v61 Fixed unit cell search. It had a much too high threshold.
      Added background indexing without blocking GUI. Indexing can be aborted now.
      Other smaller improvements.
* v60 Massive speed improvement for loading large databases. Adds a 'Last Modified' 
      column to the results table. The table is sortable by clicking on the column header now.
      Replaced the molecule viewer with a lighter one which results in a smaller install package. 
      Removed APEX database support, because searching in APEX itself works now better than in 
      StructureFinder. Some smaller improvements.
* v59 Fixed crash when running offline.
* v58 Fix crash during CIF export. Added CIF export to web interface.
* v57 Added button to export the currently selected structure as CIF. This CIF is not the original CIF!
