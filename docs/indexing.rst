Indexing files
==============

The 'Import Directory' button starts indexing of .cif or .res files below the
selected directory recursively, depending on which file ending is enabled.
It will scan all subdirectories for .cif/.res files as well as .zip files
containing .cif files. The time for indexing mostly depends on the speed of
your hard drive. Scanning a complete 256 GB SSD takes about 50s. An ten
years old complete file server with over 100 user directories and 20.000
crystal structures can take an hour.

Be aware that the indexing on a network drive is very slow!
